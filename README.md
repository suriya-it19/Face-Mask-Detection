# Face Mask Detection and Alert System

## Dataset :
	We collected the dataset from various domains and added in our project, link to download the dataset :
	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qU6aJx0c9imoggQ-5d4yPC7qG5PXC1vX?usp=sharing
		
## Steps :
    1.Train the Model using train_mask_detector.py 
         -> arguments for training 
        1. "-d", "--train", "path to input train dataset"
        2. "-t", "--test", "path to input test dataset"
        3. "-e", "--epochs", "No of Iterations"
        4. "-b", "--batch", "Batch Size"
        5. "-p", "--plot", "path to output loss/accuracy plot with name"
        6. "-m", "--model", "path to output face mask detector model with name"


## Alternate Ways :
	1.  Incase you need to use the pretrained models; The models we trained wit h150 epochs containg 5,000 Images,
	(link for the download -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bwKw0WMF1xUVBOkVJEN46KH1q86JSejj?usp=sharing)
	and start using in the cam file
      
## Face Recognition :
    Create Data of your Organization Workers or School Students or College Students, to train
  
## Alert system :
    Create an account at twilio and start using the code app.py with your API credentials.
    Note: Credentials in the won't work, replace with yours.
